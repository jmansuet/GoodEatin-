# GoodEatin-
2024 Global Game Jam submission. A story where you play as the daughter of a chef and wish to eat catfish gumbo but end up going on a blind date with a catfish. Do you go back home with him or bring him back home with you to eat?

This is a collaboration with Brennan Windsor (writing) and Michelle Xu (art)

These files are for PC and will not work for Mac (I'm sorry). I'll add a folder for Mac files eventually. Please download all the files in this repository to play the game.
